# Terminal Size Display

This Rust project uses ncurses to display the current size of your terminal window.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

You'll also need the ncurses development libraries:

- On Ubuntu or Debian:

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

- On macOS with Homebrew:

brew install ncurses

- On Windows, consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Cygwin.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or create a new Rust project:

2. Building and Running
To build and run the project, use the following commands:

cargo build
cargo run

3. *OPTIONAL* Build your project in release mode and install binary:

cargo build --release
cargo install --path .

Ensure ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH.

This process installs the binary to your user's Cargo bin directory. If you want to install it to a system-wide location like `/usr/local/bin`, you would need root permissions and would manually copy the binary after building:

sudo cp target/release/terminal_size /usr/local/bin/

Remember to adjust permissions if necessary:
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/terminal_size


## How It Works
The program will display the current size of your terminal window. Press any key to exit.

This program uses the ncurses library to:

Initialize the screen
Get the maximum Y and X coordinates (height and width)
Display the size in the center of the screen
Wait for user input before closing
